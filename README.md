# Login_System

A login system is a security feature that prevents unauthorized users from accessing resources on a website. 
There are three parts to the login system:

Signup: Signing up is the process of creating a new account. If you want to use a portal or application for the first time, you must first sign up.
Login: A login is a collection of credentials that is used to verify a user’s identity. It denotes that the user has been identified and authenticated in order to gain access to the website. The most common combination is a username and password.
Logout: To log out of a website, you must first log in. When you log out, you’re telling the website that you’d like to discontinue your login session.
